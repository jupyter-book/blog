## What is a Collaboration Cafe?

A Collaboration Cafe is a virtual co-working space [pioneered by The Turing Way][ttw-cafe]. It provides a regular meeting space featuring breakout rooms and [pomodoro](wiki:Pomodoro_Technique) sprints that allows for visitors to collaborate with other attendees on topics that they find interesting. The goal of the format is to make it easy for first-time contributors to get involved, and provide a space for multiple conversations to happen efficiently in parallel.

## Why are we joining JupyterHub's Collaboration Cafe?

The Jupyter Book team are keen to provide a synchronous meeting space for our community. Whilst we considered running our own monthly meetings, to effectively welcome new attendees and operate breakout rooms would not be feasible for our team size and time zones. Thankfully, the JupyterHub team have invited us to join them!

## When is it?

The JupyterHub community operate [their own Collaboration Cafe][hub-cafe] with its own [calendar][hub-cal]. See @schedule for the latest schedule.
