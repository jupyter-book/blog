## What is a Collaboration Cafe?

A Collaboration Cafe is a virtual co-working space [pioneered by The Turing Way][ttw-cafe]. It provides a regular meeting space that features breakout rooms and pomodoro sprints that allows for visitors to collaborate with other attendees on topics that they find interesting. The goal of the format is to make it easy for first-time contributors to get involved, and provide a space for multiple conversations to happen efficiently in parallel.

## When is it?

The Jupyter Hub community operate [their own Collaboration Cafe][hub-cafe] with its own [calendar][hub-cal]. See @schedule for the latest schedule.
